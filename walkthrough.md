**Some notes about the walkthrough:**  
- To follow this walkthrough perfectly you will need my Improvements Mod. The mod fixes how the event system works, so some events won't be available if you aren't using the mod.
- Many choices in the game don't give you the best possible scene outcome and some scenes have requirements that are easy to miss which means you can easily get a version of a scene that has less content. That's the reason I made this guide, so if you follow it you'll get 100% of the scenes and content in the the game and don't have to worry about those things.
- A lot of the dialog choices in the game don't actually affect anything, but there are still choices that give you more information, or a set of choices that will make a girl more happy, or a set of choices that will make a girl embarrassed. Anything like that will be marked as optional. Any choices that give you a better scene or more lewd content will never be marked optional. I only mark something as optional if it isn't related to scenes or lewd content.
- If there is a choice or event that isn't mentioned in the walkthrough that means it's a choice that doesn't affect anything and you can choose any option.
