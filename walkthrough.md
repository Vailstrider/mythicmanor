Any directions that start with "Optional:" means that

Any choices that give you a better scene or more lewd content will never be marked optional. I only mark something as optional if it isn't related to scenes or lewd content.

If there is dialog that gives you a better scene or more lewd images, I will always choose those and they won't be optional. 

A lot of the dialog choices in the game don't actually affect anything, but there are still choices that give more information, or a set of choices that will make a girl more happy, or a set of choices that will make a girl embarrassed.
