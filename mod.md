## Changelog:
- Changed the rollback (rewind) limit from 8 to 50! Limiting the max number of messages you could rewind was annoying and 8 was way too low.
- When you click "Skip Time Forward" the game will no longer ask if you're sure you want to skip. Needing to click "Yes" every single time you use it also got very annoying very fast. You can just rollback if you accidentally click it.
- If you know of any more small or easy changes/fixes for Mythic Manor, feel free to let me know. Just message @ me in [the thread.](https://f95zone.com/threads/mythic-manor-v0-5-1-jikei.9201/)

## Installation:
Just unzip and put it in your game folder. The patch will work with any game version, even future game updates.
